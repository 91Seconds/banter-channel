    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    The founding date of the BC is currently unknown, but is speculated to have occured during 2013 which would make the channel 3 years old. It is based loosely off the Golden Age of SPC's literature, with "The Clashing Armies" and Wolf Hospital documents founding the basis of the Channel's ethical conduct.
    The original members of the Banter Channel were Liam Prentice, Narubate Vaughan, Tom Hall and Nick Cook.

    <h2>Conflict and Guest Members</h2>
    Sam Lawrence, Hamish Kheng and Matt Borgdorff were all members of the BC for a period of time.
    <h2>The Cheeky Nando's Shout</h2>
    <img src="http://puu.sh/qU5BX/bec463d0d5.jpg" height="180" width="320"
    <br><p> The Cheeky Nando's shout tradition was started by <a href="bantercouncil.html">Ciaran King</a> upon shouting the Banter Council some cheeky nando's.
A tradition emerged upon the contingent shouting by <a href="bantercouncil.html">Narubate Vaughan<a/> and then another by <a href="bantercouncil.html">Liam Prentice</a> and by Ciaran King once again.
    It is now Narubate Vaughan's turn to shout next. Guest shoutee's have included Claudia Kazusa Keeys, Hamish Kheng, Cameron Laing and Logan Currie.

    <h2>The Slaveocracy</h2>
    Perhaps one of the BC's most prominent political philosophies was the idea of the Slaveocracy. In which, everyone was a slave, and a master.

    <h2>Banter Hour</h2>
        Banter Hour is 9:11 and 4:20, which are screenshot and sent to the group chat.
    <h2>Seening</h2>
    <h2>Cheeky Rimu's</h2>
    The Cheeky Rimu's is a Hajj undertaken by the BC. The first Hajj was met with "wind blows pm" of around 50kmh.

        <h2>Tongs</h2>
        It is speculated to be a front for a methamphetamine laboratory from due to oberservation of poor customer editique, poor management and questionable tasting chips. The combination of these factors makes it the cheekiest fish and chip in Kibirnie, and the Greater Wellington Region.

        <h2>Cupcake Cafe</h2>
        Holistically cheeky.
